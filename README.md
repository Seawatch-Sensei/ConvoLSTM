# Next Frame Prediction Using Convolutional LSTM

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `Next_Frame_Prediction_Using_Convolutional_LSTM.ipynb`, developed as part of a research project in the **AI Sustainability Lab** at Minerva University. The project was conducted by **Alaa Abbas** and **Rawan Khalifa**.

## Overview

The project implements a **Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)** model for next-frame prediction in time-series data. This task is crucial in various applications, such as weather forecasting, video prediction, and anomaly detection. ConvLSTM extends the traditional LSTM by incorporating convolutional layers, making it particularly well-suited for spatiotemporal data.

## Objectives

- **Understand and implement ConvLSTM:** Apply this deep learning architecture to process spatiotemporal sequences.
- **Evaluate performance:** Assess the model's ability to predict the next frame in a given sequence.
- **Contribute to sustainability:** Explore how advanced AI techniques can be applied to real-world sustainability challenges, such as environmental monitoring or resource management.

## Features

- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of ConvLSTM layers for processing sequential data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for preparing spatiotemporal datasets for training and evaluation.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using loss metrics and visualization of predictions.

## Files in the Repository

- `Next_Frame_Prediction_Using_Convolutional_LSTM.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the project implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd next-frame-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Next_Frame_Prediction_Using_Convolutional_LSTM.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize results.

## Results

The notebook includes:
- Training and validation loss graphs.
