# Next Frame Prediction Using Convolutional LSTM

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `Next_Frame_Prediction_Using_Convolutional_LSTM.ipynb`, developed as part of a research project in the **AI Sustainability Lab** at Minerva University. The project was conducted by **Alaa Abbas** and **Rawan Khalifa**.

## Overview

This project focuses on using a **Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)** model to predict how fruits and food spoil over time by analyzing visual changes. The model predicts the appearance of food items at future time intervals, aiding in understanding the spoilage process.

## Objectives

- Develop a ConvLSTM model to predict visual changes in food items over time.
- Enhance understanding of food spoilage processes through predictive modeling.
- Provide an academic basis for future research in food sustainability and waste reduction.

## Features

- ConvLSTM-based architecture for spatiotemporal predictions.
- Dataset preparation and preprocessing for spoilage prediction.
- Visualization tools to compare predicted and actual frames.


## Results

- Model performance visualized through training and validation loss graphs.
- Predicted vs. actual visualizations of food spoilage progression.
